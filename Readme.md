------------- Idea about the backend --------------------------


# Project File Overview

### `config/db.js`

* **What:** Database connection setup using MySQL.
* **Future:** Change connection details or DB type here.
* **Focus:** DB credentials, connection pooling, error handling.

---

### `controllers/authController.js`

* **What:** Handles login, register, update password logic.
* **Future:** Add new auth features or validations here.
* **Focus:** Business logic for user auth and security.

---

### `controllers/crudController.js`

* **What:** Generic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for any table.
* **Future:** Add data validation, error handling, complex queries.
* **Focus:** DB interactions and data manipulation.

---

### `docs/apiDocs.js`

* **What:** Stores API endpoint descriptions served at `/api`.
* **Future:** Update when adding/removing endpoints.
* **Focus:** Keep docs up-to-date for easier API use.

---

### `routes/authRoutes.js`

* **What:** Defines auth-related API routes (`/login`, `/update-password`, etc.).
* **Future:** Add/remove auth endpoints here.
* **Focus:** Connect URLs to auth controller functions.

---

### `routes/crudRoutes.js`

* **What:** Defines generic CRUD API routes (`/:table`, `/:table/:id`).
* **Future:** Modify if adding custom CRUD routes or middleware.
* **Focus:** Route structure for database CRUD operations.

---

### `utils/hashUtils.js`

* **What:** Password hashing and verification functions.
* **Future:** Update hashing algorithms or add encryption utils.
* **Focus:** Security for passwords and sensitive data.

---

### `.env`

* **What:** Stores environment variables (DB creds, JWT secret, port).
* **Future:** Add or change sensitive config values here.
* **Focus:** Never commit this to public repos!

---

### `package.json`

* **What:** Project dependencies and scripts.
* **Future:** Add/remove dependencies or scripts here.
* **Focus:** Manage npm packages.

---

### `server.js`

* **What:** Starts Express server, applies middleware, loads routes.
* **Future:** Add global middleware, new route files, error handlers.
* **Focus:** App setup and configuration entry point.

---

# General Advice

* **Routing:** Routes file only maps URLs to controllers.
* **Logic:** Put all actual work inside controllers.
* **Middleware:** Use for authentication, validation, logging, security.
* **Config:** Keep environment-specific settings in `.env` and `config/`.
* **Docs:** Always update `apiDocs.js` when API changes.
* **Security:** Use helmet, validate inputs, and keep secrets safe.
* **Errors:** Handle errors gracefully in controllers and global handlers.

# Project File Overview

### `config/db.js`  
Database connection setup (MySQL).  
- Update connection info or DB config here.  
- Focus on credentials and connection pooling.

---

### `controllers/authController.js`  
Handles user authentication: login, registration, password updates.  
- Add auth logic, validations, or new auth features here.  
- Focus on user security and token handling.

---

### `controllers/crudController.js`  
Generic CRUD operations for any database table.  
- Modify for custom data handling or add validation.  
- Handles all Create, Read, Update, Delete logic.

---

### `docs/apiDocs.js`  
API endpoint documentation served at `/api`.  
- Update this file whenever you add or remove API endpoints.  
- Helps keep API usage clear and consistent.

---

### `routes/authRoutes.js`  
Defines API routes related to authentication (e.g., `/login`, `/update-password`).  
- Add or remove auth routes here.  
- Maps URLs to auth controller methods.

---

### `routes/crudRoutes.js`  
Defines generic CRUD API routes (e.g., `/:table`, `/:table/:id`).  
- Adjust or add custom CRUD routes if needed.  
- Maps URLs to CRUD controller methods.

---

### `utils/hashUtils.js`  
Password hashing and security utilities.  
- Update hashing algorithms or add encryption tools.  
- Ensures safe password storage and verification.

---

### `.env`  
Environment variables (DB credentials, JWT secret, ports, etc.).  
- Keep all sensitive info here.  
- Never commit this file to public repositories.

---

### `package.json`  
Project dependencies and npm scripts.  
- Manage packages and scripts here.  
- Add new dependencies or update scripts as needed.

---

### `server.js`  
Main Express app setup: middleware, routes, server start.  
- Add global middleware, error handling, or new route files here.  
- Entry point for the application.

---

## General Development Guidelines

- **Routes:** Only define URL paths here; keep logic in controllers.  
- **Controllers:** All business logic and DB calls happen here.  
- **Middleware:** Use for auth checks, validation, and security (e.g., JWT verification, helmet).  
- **Config:** Store environment-specific details in `.env` and `config/`.  
- **Documentation:** Always update `docs/apiDocs.js` when API changes.  
- **Security:** Use `helmet`, validate inputs, protect secrets, and handle errors properly.  
- **Error Handling:** Use global error handlers for uncaught errors, and try-catch in controllers.
